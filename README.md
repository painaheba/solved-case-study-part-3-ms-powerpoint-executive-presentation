To the maximum extent possible, utilize the rule of 7’s – no more than seven bullets per slide, and no more than seven words per bullet.

Note: there are several tutorials on Power Point functions in the topic labeled “Optional Tutorials – Power Point project” in the Readings list for Week 8.

The details of the hardware and software solution need to be in the slides.

The purpose of this presentation is to present the hardware and software solution for a decision.  For example, make and model of hardware and short description should be in the slide but be brief and in bullet format. The speaker notes are for amplification. Slides with <strong>Speaker notes</strong> should contain <strong>at least <u>four complete sentences</u></strong> (in the notes section) each. Think of the speaker notes as what you would actually say during the presentation. Also, if someone wants to review the presentation later, the speaker notes will provide sufficient information for the reader to understand what you presented<strong>.</strong>

<strong>Points will be deducted for any spelling or grammatical errors either on the slide or in the speaker notes.</strong>

The summary MUST link the proposed solution to the requirements.

Create a presentation to outline your proposal to meet the case study requirements. Identify the purpose and audience (the Director) for your presentation.
